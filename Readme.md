## Dynamic Healthcare Consulting System 

## Introduction
1. Taking care of our health is very important in now a day. We cannot able
to concentrate on our health due to some important work, especially employees
and the side senior citizens were not able to go to the hospital for small reasons
because of their health issues or uncomfortableness.
2. To avoid these types of glitches we brought a solution through a software system along with cloud
computing technology. This software contains four modules that will make an
impact on everyone's life. This application will help people to live a healthy
life in many ways as well as bring comfortable hospitability to their homes.
3. The first module is an online counseling module, which will be going to bring
interaction between users (patients) and doctors through one single
platform. The authenticated user will enter their health issue then based upon
his/her location the application will collect the doctor’s information and listed in
front of the user’s interface along with their contact details, fees, availability, and
status. Then users can select any specialized doctor and counsel them. After
the payment, only the prescription will get downloaded to the user portal.
4. In the second module we embedded the online pharmacy system to buy the medical products
by entering the key available in the prescription. The third module is the posting
system, here healthcare-related suggestions, tips, and guidance are posted
users can benefit by that and they can write the commands for the respective
posts. The last module is search engine-based result getting for our health-related
problems.
